Troubleshooting however is my jam, maybe it is something inherent but I just love coming across obscure problems and learning how to solve them(if only I did that for the ISAs). I do have the issue of overcommitting into solving stuff, realizing am practically a nocturnal being due to sleep schedule, and often spend my nights reminiscing on what could have been, or just trying to meet insane deadlines I set for myself. I have no idea how it works, and learning about it to finally fix it(all in one night)  le pleasures in life include my code working on the first try and a pillow that is cold on both sides. I watch a lot of sports, mainly football, F1 and MotoGP. I have been a Bayern Munich fan for as long as I can remember.' },
